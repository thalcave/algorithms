/*
 * Problem: return kth smallest element of a vector
 * Solution: uses the same overall approach as quicksort, choosing one element as a pivot and partitioning the data in two based on the pivot, accordingly as less than or greater than the pivot. 
 * However, instead of recursing into both sides, as in quicksort, quickselect only recurses into one side â€“ the side with the element it is searching for. 
 * This reduces the average complexity from O(n log n) (in quicksort) to O(n) (in quickselect).
